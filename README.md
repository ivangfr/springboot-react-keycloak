# THIS IS THE NEW IMPROVED VERSION OF THIS FILE, GOOD LUCK

# springboot-react-keycloak

The goal of this project is to secure `movies-app` using [`Keycloak`](https://www.keycloak.org/). `movies-app` consists of two applications: one is a [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) Rest API called `movies-api` and another is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) application called `movies-ui`.

## Project diagram

## Applications

- **movies-api**

  `Spring Boot` Web Java backend application that exposes a Rest API to manage **movies**. Its sensitive endpoints - like create, update and delete movies - can just be just accessed if an access token (JWT) issued by `Keycloak` is provided. `movies-api` stores its data in a [`Mongo`](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

- **movies-ui**

  `ReactJS` frontend application where `users` can see the list of movies and `admins` can manage movies. In order to access the `Admin` section, the `admin` should login using his/her username and password. Those credentials are handled by `Keycloak`. All the requests coming from `movies-ui` to sensitive endpoints in `movies-api` have the access token (JWT) that is generated when the `admin` logs in. `movies-ui` uses [`Semantic UI React`](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) as CSS-styled framework.

## Prerequisites

- **jq**

  In order to run some commands/scripts, you must have [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) installed on you machine

- **OMDb API**

  To use the `Wizard` option to search and add a movie, you need to get an API KEY from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). In order to do it, access https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx and follow the steps provided by the website.

  Once you have the API KEY, create a file called `.env.local` in `springboot-react-keycloak/movies-ui` folder with the following content 
  ```
  REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
  ```

## Start environment

- In a terminal and inside `springboot-react-keycloak` root folder run
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Wait a little bit until all containers are Up (healthy). You can check their status running
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```

## Configure Keycloak

- In a terminal, make sure you are in `springboot-react-keycloak` root folder

- Run the following script to configure `movies-app` in Keycloak
  ```
  ./init-keycloak.sh
  ```

  This script creates `company-services` realm, `movies-app` client, `MANAGE_MOVIES` client role and the user `ivan.franchin` with the role `MANAGE_MOVIES` assigned.

- Copy the `MOVIESAPP_CLIENT_SECRET` value and paste it in `credentials.secret` property present in `springboot-react-keycloak/movies-ui/public/keycloak.json` file.

## Running movies-app using Maven & Npm

- **movies-api**

  - Open a terminal and navigate to `springboot-react-keycloak/movies-api` folder

  - Run the following `Maven` command to start the application
    ```
    ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9080"
    ```

- **movies-ui**

  - Open another terminal and navigate to `springboot-react-keycloak/movies-ui` folder

  - \[Optional\] Run the command below if you are running the application for the first time
    ```
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `npm` command below to start the application
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Applications URLs

| Application | URL                                   | Credentials       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| movie-api   | http://localhost:9080/swagger-ui.html | [Access Token](#getting-access-token) |
| movie-ui    | http://localhost:3000                 | ivan.franchin/123 |
| Keycloak    | http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/     | admin/admin       |

## Demo

The gif below shows an admin adding two movies using the wizard feature. First, he looks for the movie `American Pie`. The search is looking for data at [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Then, he selects the movie shown in the table. The information in the form is already fulfilled based on the response from OMDb API. The preview of the movie card, as the customer will see it, is displayed. Finally, the button `Create` is pressed and the movie is created. After that, the movie `Resident Evil` is created.

## Testing movies-api endpoints

You can manage movies by accessing directly `movies-api` endpoints using the Swagger website or `curl`. However, for the sensitive endpoints like `POST /api/movies`, `PUT /api/movies/{id}` and `DELETE /api/movies/{id}`, you need to inform an access token issued by `Keycloak`.

### Getting Access Token

- Open a terminal

- Export the `movie-app` client secret (generated on [Configure Keycloak](#configure-keycloak)) to the environment variable `MOVIESAPP_CLIENT_SECRET`
  ```
  MOVIESAPP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
  ```

- Run the following commands to get the access token
  ```
  ACCESS_TOKEN="$(curl -s -X POST \
    "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/company-services/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "username=ivan.franchin" \
    -d "password=123" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "client_secret=$MOVIESAPP_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    -d "client_id=movies-app" | jq -r .access_token)"
  ```

### Calling movies-api endpoints using curl

- Trying to add a movie without access token
  ```
  curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:9080/api/movies" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "imdbId": "tt5580036", "title": "I, Tonya", "director": "Craig Gillespie", "year": 2017, "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDY1NjYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIzNDAxNDM@._V1_SX300.jpg"}'
  ```

  It should return
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 302
  ```
  > Here, the application is trying to redirect the request to an authentication link.

- Trying again to add a movie, now with access token (obtained at #getting-access-token)
  ```
  curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:9080/api/movies" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "imdbId": "tt5580036", "title": "I, Tonya", "director": "Craig Gillespie", "year": 2017, "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDY1NjYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIzNDAxNDM@._V1_SX300.jpg"}'
  ```

  It should return
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 201
  {
    "imdbId": "tt5580036",
    "title": "I, Tonya",
    "director": "Craig Gillespie",
    "year": "2017",
    "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDY1NjYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIzNDAxNDM@._V1_SX300.jpg"
  }
  ```

- Getting the list of movies. This endpoint does not requires access token
  ```
  curl -i http://localhost:9080/api/movies
  ```

  It should return
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200
  [
    {
      "imdbId": "tt5580036",
      "title": "I, Tonya",
      "director": "Craig Gillespie",
      "year": "2017",
      "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDY1NjYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIzNDAxNDM@._V1_SX300.jpg"
    }
  ]
  ```

### Calling movies-api endpoints using Swagger

![movies-api-swagger](images/movies-api-swagger.png)

- Access `movies-api` Swagger website, http://localhost:9080/swagger-ui.html

- Click on `Authorize` button. Paste the `access token` (obtained at #getting-access-token) in the `Value` field prefixed by `Bearer`, like `Bearer <access-token>`. Then, click on `Authorize` and on `Close` to finalize.

- Done! You can now access the sensitive endpoints

## Shutdown

- Go to `movies-api` and `movies-ui` terminals and press `Ctrl+C` on each one

- To stop and remove docker-compose containers, networks and volumes, run
  ```
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

## How to upgrade movies-ui dependencies to latest version

- In a terminal, make sure you are in `springboot-react-keycloak/movies-ui` folder

- Run the following commands
  ```
  npm i -g npm-check-updates
  ncu -u
  npm install
  ```

## TODO

- add confirmation dialog before deleting a movie

## Issues

- In `package.json`, when updated `keycloak-js` to version `9.0.2`, the following CORS error appears when trying to login
  ```
  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/company-services/protocol/openid-connect/token' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
  ```
  - Maybe, it is related to the Keycloak Bug Issue [`KEYCLOAK-12542`](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-12542)
